        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Our Truth Table Solver is designed for educational use, specifically in the classes of Discrete Mathematics, 
            Discrete Structures, and Computer Architecture. 
            Our primary goal is to simplify the process for students who are relatively new to these fields, 
            allowing them to swiftly determine whether they have correctly generated a truth table. 
            It's important to note that this tool should be used solely for verification purposes, 
            ensuring the accuracy of an individual's truth table.</p>
        <p>
